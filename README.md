minesweeper
===========
Clone of Microsoft's Minesweeper from Windows XP. An effort was made to duplicate every feature (excluding menus) as exactly as possible.

Improved with game end states, new color pallette, smart tile clearing with left+right click, and a harder "Lauren" mode ;)

I may make a branch with just the end states and tile clearing to PR into the original repo.
